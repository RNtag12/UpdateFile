<h1>File Update Through A Python Algorithm</h1>

<h2> Project Description</h2>
Access to restricted content is managed using an IP address allow list. These IP addresses are listed in the "allow_list.txt" file. A separate remove list specifies which IP addresses should no longer have access 
to this content. An algorithm is developed to automate the updating of the "allow_list.txt" file and delete the IP addresses that should no longer have access. The algorithm will parse a series of IP addresses that can access restricted information and will remove the addresses that are no longer alloweed automatically.
<br />


<h2>Program steps </h2>

- <b>Open the file that contains the allow_list</b> 
- <b>Read the file contents</b>
- <b>Convert the String into a list</b> 
- <b>Iterate through the allow list</b>
- <b>Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list</b>
- <b>Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses</b>
